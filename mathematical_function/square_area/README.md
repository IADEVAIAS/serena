# Polygon Area Calculator

This is a Python program  to calculate the area of various geometric polygons, including square, rectangle, and circle.

## How it Works

The program presents a text-based interface that prompts the user to select the polygon for which they want to calculate the area. 
Subsequently, it requests the appropriate measurements (such as the side for the square, base and height for the rectangle, or radius for the circle) 
and uses the input values to compute the area of the chosen polygon.
